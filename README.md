# Bartendly
Welcome to Bartendly, a simple web application built to help you discover your favorite cocktails! This frontend is designed to work seamlessly with the REST API backend, which is powered by Spring.

Description
Bartendly allows you to select various types of alcohols, non-alcoholic ingredients, flavors, and other preferences that interest you. Based on your chosen criteria, the REST API queries the database and returns a list of cocktails that match your preferences.
